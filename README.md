# Graphics-Project
A project that simulated the famous game, "Minecraft", using freeglut (OpenGL).
This simulation required the use of the following concepts:
1. Hierarchical Objects
2. Seeding for Random Terrain Generation (with continunity along the edges that connect multiple pieces of terrain together)
3. Matrix Transformations for Character Animation
4. Texture Mapping
5. Shadow Computation via Ray Tracing
6. Trajectory Computation via BÃ©zier Curves (for the movement paths of clouds)
